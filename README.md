# 📱 React Native Practical Task App

A clean and simple React Native application built as part of a practical task.  
This project demonstrates **core mobile development skills**: navigation, API integration, state handling, and modern UI design.

## 🎯 Objective
The app is designed to showcase:
- Login screen with input validation
- Fetching and displaying posts from a public API
- Navigation across multiple screens
- State management with hooks
- A simple counter app
